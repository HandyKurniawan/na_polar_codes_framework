## Setup

### Installation

Note: This installation guide will work for Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.11.5

#### Clone Github

First, you need to clone the project to get all the necessary files

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/HandyKurniawan/na_polar_codes_framework.git
cd na_polar_codes_framework
```

#### MariaDB

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. Install MariaDB:
   
``` terminal
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

2. Secure your MariaDB installation:

``` terminal
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

3. Create a database and user:

Login with the root account to the database

``` terminal
mysql -u root -p
```

Then you can create a new user from here

``` mysql
CREATE USER 'user_1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '1234';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user_1'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user_1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '1234' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
CREATE DATABASE  IF NOT EXISTS `framework`;
exit;
```

4. Import table structures:

``` terminal
mysql -u user_1 -p framework < mariadb/framework_structure.sql
mysql -u user_1 -p framework < mariadb/data.sql
```
Note: These commands need to be run one by one, and the password for user_1 is 1234

Now your database is ready.

#### Framework

First, you need to go to the home folder of the project (\na_polar_codes_framework)

Note: If you have an older version (or if you don't have it) of Python please upgrade (install) it first:

``` terminal
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa    
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install python3.11
```

Install dependencies and set up the Python environment:

``` terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.xx-venv 
sudo apt-get install libmuparser2v5
sudo apt-get install libz3-dev
python3.xx -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
`Python3.xx` is depends on what Python3.xx version you have

#### Config

Now, you need to update the `config.ini` file to change the config for the database, and the path for the TriQ before continue

```terminal
[MySQLConfig]
user = user_1
password = 1234
host = localhost
database = framework
...
```

You can also set the default value in `config.ini` to compile the circuit:

```terminal
[QuantumConfig]
; put your IBM token here
token = put_your_ibm_token_here
; Which hardware to run the quantum circuit
hardware_name = ibm_sherbrooke
; Base folder to put the qasm files
base_folder = ./circuits/adder/
; Total number of shots
shots = 4000
; Number of duplication running the same circuits
runs = 1
...
```

#### Calibration Data

We need to update Triq's config based on the latest calibration data to properly run it. The script to retrieve calibration data from IBM can be seen [here](https://github.com/HandyKurniawan/na_polar_codes_framework/tree/main/wrappers/triq_wrapper) with file name `retrieve_calibration_data.py`. The calibration data will be saved in the database.

Now, you are good to go üöÄ


## Usage example

We include a [demo](https://github.com/HandyKurniawan/na_polar_codes_framework/blob/main/demo.ipynb) Jupiter notebook for the full implementation of quantum polar codes of length N=18 and N=32, with options to run in the simulation and the real backends. Note: An IBM token is needed to run the demo.

### Example of running code of length N=16 (n=3) for logical |+> 

First, you need to import the installed framework, **NAPC**. The token is also needed since you need to run the simulator with the calibration-based noise model from IBM.

```python
from NAPC import NAPC, conf

# update with your IBM Token
token = "put_your_ibm_token_here"
```
Then, you need to initialize the NAPC object. _runs_ is a parameter to duplicate the circuits x numbers of times, and _token_ is the IBM token. 

```python
# initialize the object using the provided token
q = NAPC(runs=conf.runs, token=token)
```
Since noise-aware compilation needs the latest calibration data, you need to always check the latest calibration data and update TriQ configs through this function: `update_hardware_configs`

```python
# command to run the update TriQ's reliability matrix for the noise-aware routing
q.update_hardware_configs()
```

The framework will pick all the qasm files in the selected folders. In this case, it is the example of polar codes for logical + with length N=16 (n=3). This will return the paths of the files under the selected folders. 

```python
file_path="./QEC/polar_code/n3/x"
qasm_files = q.get_qasm_files_from_path(file_path)
```
TriQ has been updated to make it possible to apply mid-circuit measurement. For this purpose, you need to specify which qasm files need a mid-circuit measurement or not. All the other settings are:

- normal: only measurement at the end
- polar: for middle measurement circuit
- polar_meas: for polar with measurement
- polar_mix: for polar with measurement (no middle measurement)

See file [run_simulation.py](https://github.com/HandyKurniawan/na_polar_codes_framework/blob/main/run_simulation.py) to see which code lengths are needed for which triq measurement type.

```python
# this is the setup to enable mid-circuit measurement for TriQ
triq_measurement_type="polar_meas"
```
Now, you need to declare the physical error rate scaling factor, where **0** is noiseless, and **1** is standard noise. It can be set up from 0 to 1.

```python
# choosing the noise level
noise_levels = [0.1, 1.0]
```
And the final configuration part is to set the backend

```python
# then we setup the backend and run the simulator
q.set_backend(program_type="sampler", shots=shots)
```

To run the program to the **Simulator**, you can use this function

```python
q.run_simulator("sampler", qasm_files, compilations, noise_levels, shots)
```

while if you want to run in the **Real backend**, you can use this function

```python
q.send_to_real_backend("sampler", qasm_files, compilations, shots=shots)
```

When the result is ready, you can calculate or retrieve the result with this function. Note: for the simulator, the result will be simulated in this function.

```python
# get the result and calculate the metric
q.get_qiskit_result("simulator")
```
**Notes: choice of backend and number of shots can be changed from the `config.ini` file.**

### Accessing the result in the database

The full example can be seen in the [demo](https://github.com/HandyKurniawan/na_polar_codes_framework/blob/main/demo.ipynb) Jupiter notebook

```python
conn = mysql.connector.connect(**mysql_config)
cursor = conn.cursor()

sql = """
SELECT header_id, circuit_name, compilation_name, noise_level, 
polar_count_accept, polar_count_logerror, polar_count_undecided, success_rate_polar, total_two_qubit_gate,
initial_mapping
FROM result WHERE header_id = 2;
""".format(1, "ibm_sherbrooke")

 # insert to circuit
cursor.execute(sql)

results = cursor.fetchall()

cursor.close()
conn.close()
```
